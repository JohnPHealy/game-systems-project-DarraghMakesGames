<strong>Important Note: </strong>This asset uses Linear Color Space. To set this up in your scene, in Unity go to <strong>Edit >> Project Settings >> Player </strong>, then in the <strong>Other Settings</strong> section of the Inspector in the <strong>Color Space*</strong> drop-down menu, select <strong>Linear</strong>. Using other Color Space settings tends to make colours look washed-out / flat.
